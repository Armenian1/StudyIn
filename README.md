Description:
  For university students who have the desire to network with colleagues within mutual majors and courses, StudyIn is a college-based social network mobile app that facilitates communication between students that wish to make study groups and more. Unlike other social networks such as Facebook and Tinder, which lack the collegiate focus that university students need, our product will cater to a student’s academic and social success.
  Going to office hours is a great resource to learn course material, however, instructors can't always explain complex problems in a way a typical student can understand; with a quick post to your wall, you could be able to find people local in your area who can simplify subjects since they are learning alongside you. StudyIn app strives to bridge gaps that has grown between students as technology has evolved, and to teach cooperation which can only be learned first hand; after you set up your profile, the app will automatically generate lists of people who are in the same classes as you, and if no one has the app, don't worry people in your major can see your wall posts as well.
  StudyIn not only provides an easy and quick way to connect with students for schoolwork purposes, but can also help you create lifetime friendships with those studying a similar field as you in college. Having friendships with those in similar classes as you can help you stay on track with all of your schoolwork requirements while having fun in college at the same time.  

Vision Statement:
To connect the sphere of young scholars united in their purpose to achieve mastery in their college classes.

Motivation:
One of most impactful aspects of attending a university is collaborating with fellow colleagues to bring out your greatest potential in your desired major. However, between schedule availability, study style, personality conflicts, and so on, finding those colleagues best suited to amplify one’s strengths can be challenging. StudyIn seeks to eliminate all barriers to effective group study by filtering the huge list of potential (study) partners and presenting the user with only their most compatible peers.

Risks:
Primary Risks: with each team member managing various courses, finding time to meet with conflicting schedules may be a challenge; none of us have ever tackled a project of this size and complexity, and we may need to learn additional tools to make certain functionality possible (server coding, for example, as well a Android app development as a whole); as with any social-based application, the outset after deployment of the app may be rough as too few students will be using the network to be reliably matched up.

Risk Mitigation Plan:
Ideas for resolving those risks: coordinating schedules to find times to meet up, potentially involving a centralized calendar of availability (Google’s calendar may take care of this, or else we could lessen the issue by forming smaller sub-teams to tackle individual features/issues with the code); making use of widely-available coding resources, both in terms of tutorials as in https://coronalabs.com/ and in terms of inspiration from pre-fab web code such as in https://codemyui.com/; advertising in CU-based networks (such as Facebook pages, on large classroom blackboards, etc.). According to app research many apps start out in small groups, and spread by word of mouth like wild fire, so for the early Beta/Alpha stages of this app deployment to small groups such as “Comp Sci major at cu boulder” would be a great start. Due to our limited resources at the moment and not having a deal with collegiate databases, we will be running our app on a private database. 

Version Control:
The version control method and repository our team will be using for the deliverables created for this project is Github, an Open Source Distributed Repository Version Control System. Github will allow our team to coordinate and work on the same module at the same time, keep a log of call changes and versions, and create branches and merge management. Our team will also use the best practices in version control, including committing early and often, communicating by using clear commit messages, and resolving any merge conflicts.

Development Method:
The software development methodology our team will most closely follow is Agile. The Agile methodology is most suitable for our project due to the fact that (1) it is done in incremental, iterative development cycles rather than unretractable steps, (2) it is welcome to changing requirements, even late in development, and (3) working software is the primary measure of progress. Our team will follow the Agile Model by self-organization, focus on project features, and continuous improvement and delivery. Our team will also adopt some of the features of the Scrum methodology, which uses “sprints” (length of which will be determined by our due dates) to prioritize user stories by the highest value and produce fully functional features. 

Collaboration Tool:
The collaboration tool our team will be using for coordination of work and communication among team members is Slack. For data sharing we will be developing and sharing code via github.
